# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project we learned about Jupyter Notebook as a tool for a variety of sources where code can be created, shared, and visualized through differrent libraries. In this Module, we focused on Pandas.

We learned how to import the Pandas library into our Notebook, as well as importing our data with a .csv format; and to create Data Frames.

With this file, we are able to understand and compare the results in between fifteen different High Schools, where some are Public, and some are Charter-modeled schools.

### Purpose
After cleaning our data, we analized the results of reading and math scores for students in between the 9th and 12th grade.

## Analysis and Challenges
It is important to notice that the average result for math scores for students from a Charter school in the 9th grade (70.07), is higher than the average score for a student from a Public school (63.77). This is true for students in the 10th grade and 11th grade as well, showing a higher average score. However is not for the 12th grade students of a Public High School who averaged 63.57 in their math scores, while Charter students averaged 60.21.

When analizing the results for the reading scores for both type of High Schools, we found that the student with the minimum reading score belongs to Charter modeled High School, defying the notion that a Charter school could have been portrayed as better than a Public school, based solely in math scores results.

Furthermore, it is important to consider that our data shows that the average budget of a Charter School is lower than the average budget of a Public school.

## Results
Overall, the performance of students that attend a Pubic High School it may be slightly higher in their reading results, just as the results for math scores are for students that belong to a Carter High School.

We can conclude that one type of High School cannot be named better than the other as one exceeds in aspects where the other one does not, and vice versa.
